Hi, I'm Justyna, I'm 24. 

I was programming in high school, we learned the basics there. Then I used programming to analyze the data during my studies. I'm more and more interested in this world and I feel that it could be a very interesting job for me. Therefore, I would like to take this course.

Thanks for getting to this place and I really hope to see you later.
